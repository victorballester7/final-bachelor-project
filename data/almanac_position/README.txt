This data service provides geocentric position data for the major solar system bodies and selected bright stars. This includes right ascension and declination for apparent and astrometric position types, distances for solar system objects, magnitudes for the planets, and the equation of time for the Sun. The apparent position is calculated in reference to the true equator and equinox of date. 

The data is printed in a 5-minut interval.

For the moon the columns of the data are:

<year> <month> <day> <hour>:<minute>:<second> <right ascension (in hours, minuts, and seconds)> <declination (in degrees, arcminutes, and arcseconds)> <distance (in km)> 

For the sun the columns of the data are:

<year> <month> <day> <hour>:<minute>:<second> <right ascension (in hours, minuts, and seconds)> <declination (in degrees, arcminutes, and arcseconds)> <distance (in AU)>
