Format of the data

<mjd_utc> <x_teme> <y_teme> <z_teme> <vx_teme> <vy_teme> <vz_teme> <error>

where mjd_utc are the modified julian dates, x,y,z are the position in m in the TEME frame, vx,vy,vz are the velocity in m/s in the TEME frame and error is the interpolated error (in km) between the SGP4 propagator and the TLE data.
